Your job is to answer a multiple choice question about a video.

You are given some language descriptions of individual frames at different timestamps of the video. The video is INSERT_LENGTH seconds long. Here are the descriptions: INSERT_INFO_HERE

Give a brief explanation, then return the index of the best choice after the words "Final Answer:" in your response at the end. Do not include anything other than the index of the answer as an integer after "Final Answer:". Your answer must be one of the integers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Here is the question: INSERT_QUESTION_HERE
Here are the choices: INSERT_CHOICES_HERE

If there are multiple possible answers, use context clues and logical reasoning to select the best answer. Let's think step by step.
