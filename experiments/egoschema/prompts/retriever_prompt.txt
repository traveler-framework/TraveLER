You are given the following information about a INSERT_LENGTH_HERE second video, with information from individual frames at different timestamps.

Here is the information: INSERT_INFO_HERE

You are also given a plan to follow.

Here is the plan: INSERT_PLAN_HERE

Currently, you are viewing second INSERT_CURR_HERE of the video. Please choose the timestamp, in seconds, of the next frame to view. When choosing the next frame to view, remember that you are trying to collect information to answer this multiple-choice question: INSERT_QUESTION_HERE. 

Think of what information you need, and consider what information you already have. Use the temporal nature of the video and your past information to choose the next frame. Do not choose a frame you already have information about, and make sure that the frame you choose is at least 5 seconds apart from the second you are currently viewing.

Give an explanation for why you chose this frame. Then, after the word "Timestamp:" give your timestamp as a single Python float for the number of seconds into the video you want to view. Don't include anything other than the timestamp after "Timestamp:".
