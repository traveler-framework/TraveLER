Evaluate if there is enough information to answer a multiple-choice question about a video and if the plan has been completed.

If there is enough information to choose the correct answer with complete certainty and the plan has been followed, return the index of the choice after a brief explanation. Otherwise, return None after a brief explanation of why you can't narrow down to a single answer choice. Be strict and don't guess.

Include your final answer after the words "Final Answer:" in your response at the end. Do not include anything other than the answer as an integer or None after "Final Answer:".
