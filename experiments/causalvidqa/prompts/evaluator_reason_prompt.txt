Your job is to evaluate if there is enough information to answer a multiple-choice question about a video with complete certainty.

Please evaluate if there is enough information to answer the following multiple choice question and if the plan has been completed.

If there is enough information to choose the correct answer and the correct reason, with complete certainty, and the plan has been followed, give an explanation and include your final answer and final reason in JSON format {"final_answer": <index of correct answer>, "final_reason": <index of correct reason>} without Markdown (```json). Otherwise, give a brief explanation of why you can't narrow down a single answer choice or a single reason and return None (not null) in the JSON such as {"final_answer": None, "final_reason": None}. Within the JSON, do not include anything other than the answer and reason as an integer or None. Be strict on if there is enough info and don't use guesswork.

Always give an explanation followed by JSON!
