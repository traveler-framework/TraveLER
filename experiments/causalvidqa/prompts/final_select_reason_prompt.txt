Your job is to answer a multiple-choice question about a video.

You are given some language descriptions of individual frames at different timestamps of the video. The video is INSERT_LENGTH seconds long. Here are the descriptions: INSERT_INFO_HERE

Give a brief explanation, then include your best answer and best reason in JSON format {"final_answer": <index of correct answer>, "final_reason": <index of correct reason>} without Markdown (```json). Within the JSON, do not include anything other than the answer and reason as one of the integers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Be sure to only respond in JSON!

Here is the question: INSERT_QUESTION_HERE
Here are the choices: INSERT_CHOICES_HERE
Here are the reasons: INSERT_REASONS_HERE

If there are multiple possible answers, use context clues and logical reasoning to select the best answer. Let's think step by step.
