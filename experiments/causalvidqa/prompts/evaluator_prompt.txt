Your job is to evaluate if there is enough information to answer a multiple-choice question about a video with complete certainty.

Please evaluate if there is enough information to answer the following multiple choice question and if the plan has been completed.

If there is enough information to choose the correct answer with complete certainty and the plan has been followed, give an explanation and include your final answer in JSON format {"final_answer": <index of correct answer>} without Markdown (```json). Otherwise, give a brief explanation of why you can't narrow down a single answer choice and return None (not null) in the JSON such as {"final_answer": None}. Within the JSON, do not include anything other than the answer as an integer or None. Be strict on of there is enough info and don't use guesswork.

Always give an explanation followed by JSON!
