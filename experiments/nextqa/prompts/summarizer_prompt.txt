Your job is to summarize the information about a video.

Here is the information: INSERT_INFO_HERE. 

The information is collected from individual frames and represented as a Python dictionary, with the keys being the timestamps and the values being a list of information collected from that frame.

When summarizing, remember that you are trying to create the best summary to answer this question: INSERT_QUESTION_HERE, which has the following choices: INSERT_CHOICES_HERE. However, don't try to answer the question here or talk about the question in your summary.

Return your summary after OUTPUT, in the same format as the original (dict[str, lst[str]]). Wrap strings in double quotes and double check your output is parseable as a Python dictionary, but don't include any backticks or language indicators. Don't return any explanation, only return the actual summary.

OUTPUT:
